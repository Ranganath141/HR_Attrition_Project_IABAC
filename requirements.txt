## Requirements

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling
- XGBoost for experimental gradient boosting
- Logistic Regression as Base Model
- Decision Tree and Ensemble models as performance Model

## Methodology Notes

- Logistic Regression was used as the primary predictive model due to its interpretability and effectiveness on imbalanced datasets.
- Class imbalance was handled using class weighting and threshold tuning.
- Model evaluation prioritized recall for the minority attrition class based on business impact.
- Ensemble models were evaluated for comparison but not selected due to lower minority-class recall.
